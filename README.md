# Fraudshield-Predictive-Analytics-for-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Exploring and implementing various machine learning algorithms to create an intelligent system for detecting fraudulent credit card activities with high accuracy.

## The Objectives of this Project are:  
- To detect fraudulent activities in credit card transactions and predict the result. 
- Compare some efficient machine learning algorithms, find better accuracy, and suggest a model. 
- Visualize dataset through model graphs using Python libraries. 
- Integrate machine learning model in the web-based framework for better user interface and user experience.
- To develop an accurate and efficient machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud. 
- To integrate the selected machine learning model with the Streamlit web framework to create a user-friendly and interactive interface for fraud detection. 
- To provide a reliable and secure fraud detection system that can be deployed to production environments such as web servers or mobile applications. 
- To improve the performance of the model using techniques such as oversampling or undersampling, ensemble learning, or hyperparameter tuning. 
- To comply with data protection laws and regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) to ensure the  privacy and security of the data used for training and testing the model. 
- To evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score and identify areas for improvement. 
- To provide a solution that can be easily maintained and updated as new data and techniques become available. 
- To increase the efficiency and speed of the fraud detection process, thus reducing the time taken to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. 
- To reduce financial losses for individuals and companies that fall victim to credit card fraud. 
- To contribute to the advancement of machine learning and data science techniques for fraud detection and prevention. 
- To provide a useful tool for financial institutions, merchants, and individuals to monitor their credit card transactions and prevent fraudulent activities. 
- To increase awareness about the prevalence of credit card fraud and the importance of using advanced technology to prevent it.
